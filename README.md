# key-value-react-app
a simple dummy app using react and localstorage to store the entered data from user

#Overview

In this exercise, you will create a simple React application that uses LocalStorage to store and retrieve data. LocalStorage is a browser-based storage mechanism that allows data to be stored and accessed even after the browser is closed.

##Instructions

Create a simple form that allows the user to enter a key-value pair.
When the form is submitted, store the key-value pair in LocalStorage.
Create a table that displays all of the key-value pairs stored in LocalStorage.
Add functionality to the table that allows the user to delete specific key-value pairs.
Add a button that clears all of the key-value pairs stored in LocalStorage.

##Bonus requirements

Add validation to the form to ensure that the user enters both a key and a value.
Add error handling for cases where LocalStorage is not available (e.g., in incognito mode).
Implement sorting functionality for the table based on the key or value.
Use LocalStorage events to update the table in real time when data is added, deleted, or modified.
Before you dive into the final output, I want to encourage you to take some time to work through the exercise yourself. I believe that active learning is the most effective way to learn and grow as a developer.
So, grab a pen and paper, fire up your code editor, and get ready to dive into the React LocalStorage exercise. Once you have completed the exercise, feel free to return to this blog post to compare your solution to mine.
